# Data-Visualization Using Python

The main goal of this project is to take ‘Food Database’ that at first glance has little meaning and present that data in a form that makes sense to people. I performed data analysis and machine learning operations such as Data Mining, Data Manipulation and Data Cleaning using Numpy, Matplotlib, and Pandas.
